Methods 
- Divide and Conquer [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_conquer_algorithm] : recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.
- Dynamic Programming [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming] :  breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions. The next time the same subproblem occurs, instead of recomputing its solution, one simply looks up the previously computed solution, thereby saving computation time at the expense of a (hopefully) modest expenditure in storage space. (Each of the subproblem solutions is indexed in some way, typically based on the values of its input parameters, so as to facilitate its lookup.) The technique of storing solutions to subproblems instead of recomputing them is called "memoization".
- Greedy Algorithm [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm] : making the locally optimal choice at each stage[1] with the hope of finding a global optimum.
